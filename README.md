# Exists
A python script to check whether a file or directory exists or not. I know I need this file a lot so I uploaded it to Github for others!

## Usage

<i>Note:</i> Requires Python 3.x

`python3 exists.py [path-to-file]`

OR

`python3 exists.py [path-to-directory]`

You can add more then one file by separating each path by a space!

`python3 exists.py [path-to-file-or-dir] [path-to-second-file-or-dir]`


### TODO

- Add windows support (sorry)
