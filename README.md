# Exists
A python script to check whether a file or directory exists or not. I know I need this file a lot so I uploaded it to Github for others!

## Installation
Open up terminal in the project folder and just do:

```sh install.sh```

That's it! You will now be able to type the command `exists.py` anywhere on the computer without typing `python [path-to-exists]`!

## Usage

`exists.py [path-to-file]`

OR

`exists.py [path-to-directory]`

You can add more then one file by separating each path by a space!

`exists.py [path-to-file-or-dir] [path-to-second-file-or-dir]`


### TODO

- Add windows support (sorry)
